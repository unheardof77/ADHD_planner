# ADHD_planner
Ideal planner for an ADHD brain.

This planner should have 3 views. First being a day view where you can add events to the day and rank with importance (1-10).  The second will be a week view highlighting the most important events on each day. The third view will be a month long calender highlighting the most imporant events of each week.  Events should be easily copy able, repeatable, and color coded.
